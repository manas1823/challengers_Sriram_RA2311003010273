Problem statement : 

Refugees and tourists face significant financial challenges due to limited access to traditional banking, lack of identification documents, reliance on cash, vulnerability to theft and exploitation, unfavorable exchange rates, high transaction fees, and confusion from lack of financial knowledge.
